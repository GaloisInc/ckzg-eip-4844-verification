# Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) Verification

## Installation

Download the SAW binary from the [SAW website](https://saw.galois.com).

The minimum required version of SAW is [1.2](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/releases/tag/v1.2).

You will also need to install the Java Runtime Environment (this is required for running SAW with Java even if this feature is not used).

You will also need to have Clang installed.

You may also need to install [Yices](https://yices.csl.sri.com) and [CVC5](https://cvc5.github.io).

### MacOS

For mac users, make sure to install `llvm@16` from Homebrew.

```bash
brew install llvm@16
```

You also need to ensure that your CC environment variable is pointing to the installed version above.

## Generating the Bit-code

SAW performs verification by first running symbolic execution on the C LLVM bit-code to generate a model of the computation. SAW then tries to prove this model equivalent to the corresponding model generated by the Cryptol specification using a backend SMT solver (default is Z3).

So we need to generate the LLVM bit-code for the C code we want to verify. That is done by the following command:

```bash
clang -g -O1 -c -emit-llvm file.c -o file.bc
```

For convenience, we have a Makefile in the `bitcode` subfolder that can autogenerate the needed LLVM bitcode. Run the following:

```bash
make bc
```

The first time you run this command you'll see the following output:

```text
[+] applying patch file
cd ../../c-kzg-4844/src && /path-to/usr/bin/make bc
[+] generating bitcode
cp ../../c-kzg-4844/src/ckzg.bc ckzg.bc
```

Afterward, you'll see the following output:

```text
[+] patch file already applied
cd ../../c-kzg-4844/src && /path-to/usr/bin/make bc
[+] generating bitcode
cp ../../c-kzg-4844/src/ckzg.bc ckzg.bc
```

## Running the proofs

To execute a SAW script and check the proofs, run the following command:

```bash
CRYPTOLPATH="$(pwd)/../spec/" saw <file>.saw
```

Any dependent Cryptol modules will be compiled first, and any errors will immediately end the executation and be reported.

### Example SAW run

Running the following command:

```bash
CRYPTOLPATH="$(pwd)/../spec/" saw permutations.saw
```

Results in output similar to:

```text

### Run all proofs

To check all available proofs, run the following Makefile command:

```bash
make proofs
```
