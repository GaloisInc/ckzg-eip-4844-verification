# Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) Verification

## Installation

Download the SAW binary from the [SAW website](https://saw.galois.com).

You will also need to install the Java Runtime Environment (this is required for running SAW with Java even if this feature is not used).

You will also need to have Clang installed.

### MacOS

For mac users, make sure to install `llvm` from Homebrew.

```bash

 $> brew install llvm

```

## Generating the Bit-code

SAW performs verification by first running symbolic execution on the C LLVM bit-code to generate a model of the computation. SAW then tries to prove this model equivalent to the corresponding model generated by the Cryptol specification using a backend SMT solver (default is Z3).

So we need to generate the LLVM bit-code for the C code we want to verify. That is done by the following command:

```bash
clang -g -O1 -c -emit-llvm file.c -o file.bc
```
