# Formal Verification of the c-kzg library: Establishing the Basis

## Overview

This repository holds the work performed under Grant ID FY24-1544 of the Ethereum Foundation (EF). The purpose of this grant is to explore the viability of using the [Cryptol language](cryptol.net) and the [Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)](https://saw.galois.com) to formally verify the EF's [c-kzg library](https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844/tree/main) against the [consensus-specs Deneb specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/deneb).

## c-kzg Submodule

We use the [c-kzg repository](https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844.git) as a Git submodule, so you will need to either clone recursively or initialize that submodule.
